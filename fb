Looking for that perfect ride around campus but on-campus stores are too overpriced?

Get a skateboard today!
I can build you a board with any parts you want (Deck, trucks, wheels, hardware, bearings, rails, lights, grip tape, etc.). Penny boards, long boards, trick boards, carvers, and everything else.

 If you're not quite sure what you want, you can also tell me what you plan to do with your board and I can recommend several builds for you to choose from.

 Want a bicycle instead? Same deal as skateboards. Everything is completely made to order using 100% new parts from amazon and reputable bike shops and I can build it to your specs or recommend a build to suit your needs.

 Send me a Facebook message and we can make your ride happen!
