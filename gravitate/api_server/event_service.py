        This method allows the user to post an event.
            Expect a JSON form in request.json
        For now, handle only local time in "America/Los_Angeles"

        Form fields required:
            "eventCategory": "campus" | "social"
            "eventLocation" (A user-defined text description such as "LAX")
            "locationRef" (Should have been generated by earlier steps in workflow)
            "startLocalTime"
            "endLocalTime"
            "pricing": 100

        Validation:
            Reject if:
                eventCategory is "airport", or is not one of "campus", "social"
                locationRef is the same as any airport locationRef
                ...
            Allow pricing to be empty, and fill in default value
